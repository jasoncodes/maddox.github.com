title: Nginx + SSL from Network Solutions
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

These days you need an intermediate cert when using an SSL. Last time I set up a cert from Network Solutions, this intermediate cert was clearly named. This time around they issued quite a few certs and it made it confusing.

* AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt
* MY.DOMAIN.COM.crt
* NetworkSolutions_CA.crt
* UTNAddTrustServer_CA.crt


The two certs we care about here are *MY.DOMAIN.COM.crt*, my site's ssl cert, and NetworkSolutions_CA.crt, Network Solution's intermediate key.

Ok, now the tricky part. With old Apache, there was a specific directive for defining the intermediate cert. Nginx participates in no such thing. With Nginx we just need to cat our two certs together.

 
{% highlight bash%}
cat MY.DOMAIN.COM.crt NetworkSolutions_CA.crt > combined.crt
{% endhighlight %}

Now just add this to your conf with:

{% highlight bash %}
ssl_certificate /usr/local/nginx/certs/combined.crt;
{% endhighlight %}
