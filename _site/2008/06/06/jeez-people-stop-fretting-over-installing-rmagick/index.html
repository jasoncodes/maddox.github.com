  <h1>Jeez People, Stop Fretting Over Installing RMagick</h1>
<p>Rmagick. It sucks, I know. We all hate it. But you have apps that depend on it and haven&#8217;t changed that yet. So you need it installed for development. And you hate installing it.</p>
<p>But really, its not that installing RMagick sucks, its installing ImageMagick that sucks. Its hard. But the only thing worse than hard, is stupid ass MacPorts. Which is ********.</p>
<p>So all I hear is people complain over and over about having to install it. Meanwhile there has been a script to install ImageMagick and RMagick on OS X forever, but people just don&#8217;t seem to know its there.</p>
<p>I tell people about it and they just ignore me and then complain about installing RMagick to me later on!! <span class="caps">WTF</span>?!</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve had it. When you format or get a new computer go here: <del datetime="2009-01-22T07:54:59+00:00"><a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=12&release_id=21634">http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=12&amp;release_id=21634</a></del></p>
<p><del datetime="2009-01-22T07:58:22+00:00">Download rm_install</del></p>
<p>That old script isn&#8217;t maintained and never works. I&#8217;ve decided to post one myself on GitHub with the hope that people will not only use it, but make sure it never gets stale. Grab it here: <a href="http://www.github.com/maddox/magick-installer"> http://www.github.com/maddox/magick-installer </a></p>
<p>Now, once its downloaded. Do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ./magick-installer.sh
</pre>
</div><p>and let it run forever. Done. Pretty easy right? There. <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">USE</span> IT. Its a fantastic script that works really well. Its not hard to install ImageMagick anymore! Dance!</p>
