  <h1>Git It?</h1>
<p>While working today I think I heard <span class="caps">GIT</span> mentioned on every form of communication I use daily. It was mentioned in several <span class="caps">IRC</span> channels, on twitter a ton, in an email, over IM, and a couple of new posts in my feeds. It has become obvious that <span class="caps">GIT</span> has hit the early adopter phase.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to <em>sell</em> <span class="caps">GIT</span> or even try to explain why it&#8217;s so great. There are tons of places online that already do that. I&#8217;m just going to share a couple stories.</p>
<h4>Who Gives a Crap, I Gotta Get Work Done</h4>
<p>This new source code management software that seems to be gaining a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> amount of steam first popped on my radar early last summer. I contemplated playing with it, but like most things, I skipped it. I figured as a single developer, it wouldn&#8217;t mean much to me. I code,commit, iterate. <em>&#8220;What do i need with fancy branching?&#8221;</em> I <a href="http://twitter.com/maddox/statuses/170044712">said</a>. But <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">@peterc</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc/statuses/170110182">replied</a> with my answer. I just didn&#8217;t get it then.</p>
<p>Months went by as I used <span class="caps">SVN</span> like everyone else. I was just happy with versioned code, that&#8217;s about all that <span class="caps">SVN</span> did for me.</p>
<h4>RubyConf 2007</h4>
<p>As I was outside with the rest of the Ruby Smoking Crew, I got Chris Wanstrath, unofficial <span class="caps">GIT</span> ambassador, to try to sell me on it. He started with the normal branching pitch, and I stoppped him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t branch&#8221;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t use <span class="caps">GIT</span>&#8221;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BOOM. It hit me. I don&#8217;t <strong>branch</strong> because branching with <span class="caps">SVN</span> <strong>sucks</strong> so much fucking arse that it&#8217;s just not worth it. <span class="caps">CERTAINLY</span> not for changes that take only a few hours. With <span class="caps">SVN</span> you hang out on trunk and make your thousands of commits. Forget if you want to try something wacky real fast, you&#8217;d have to branch it! And thats just a whole lot of work.</p>
<h4>Fast Forward a Few Days.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting in a cube at Yahoo!. I&#8217;d been given a task a few days earlier. I was working on it and hit a stopping point. I needed to make a huge sweeping change. <span class="caps">BUT</span>, two hours later, I had to demo it to a room full of Yahoo! people I had never even met. <span class="caps">AND</span> they expected it to work. I knew my changes were going to break the whole app for a little while.</p>
<p>Ok, so first off, this project was neither IN a repository, nor did I even have access to one. I&#8217;d only been there for like two days. So I could copy my source directory and file it away for the demo, or&#8230; I could finally throw <span class="caps">GIT</span> on my laptop and try it out! So I installed <span class="caps">GIT</span>, initialized my rep. Branched it&#8230;whoa what? Thats it. <code>git checkout -b new_model</code>? Thats it?! <span class="caps">SICK</span>.</p>
<p>I continued my work and when it came time for the demo I just used <code>git checkout master</code> and voila, I was back to my fully working copy. I finally &#8216;got&#8217; <span class="caps">GIT</span>. At least the branching part. Not only is it easy to branch, you can branch locally. And by locally, I mean privately. So if you want to try something weird and crazy out, you don&#8217;t need to worry about making a new branch at the central repository, just branch it locally and go to town. If it worked out, merge it back into <em>master</em>. If it doesn&#8217;t, just dump it. Now, like most <span class="caps">GIT</span> users, I don&#8217;t even work directly on master.</p>
<p>Ok, thats my story. I guess the moral is, you&#8217;re never going to get why something is good for <span class="caps">YOU</span> until <span class="caps">YOU</span> use it. Everyone takes different things away from products, especially when you&#8217;re talking about productivity.</p>
