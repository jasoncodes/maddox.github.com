Yay! Its finally here! The newest version of my favorite operating system. And it comes with 98% of my dev stack ALREADY installed! Yay! This is perfect.

Wait&#8230; ok, no MySql. Thats ok, I'll just install it&#8230;Wait&#8230; why isn't it running&#8230;why isn't this stupid preference panel turning it on! ARGHHH!

Ok, that may have just happened to you, and you dramatically hit the Google looking for answers. So answers I give you.

If you want to start MySql in Leopard, you need to call the startup item directly from the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start
{% endhighlight %}

And to stop it:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM stop
{% endhighlight %}

Not so bad. But long... So make an alias in your _.bash_profile_

{% highlight bash %}
alias start_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start"
alias stop_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM stop"
{% endhighlight %}

Happier? Relaxed? Good.
