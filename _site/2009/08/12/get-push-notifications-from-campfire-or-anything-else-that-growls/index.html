  <h1>Get Push Notifications From Campfire or Anything Else That Growls</h1>
<p>Use Case:</p>
<p>You&#8217;re away from your computer and something tragic/awesome happens in Campfire. Someone pings you, but you&#8217;re not there to get it. You come back to your desktop with 100 growl messages of people pinging you in Campfire, and you missed something tragic/awesome. Eff that. Thats what happens to you. Here&#8217;s what happens to me:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the couch, someone pings me in Campfire: &#8220;Maddox, we&#8217;re adding an instance because of load&#8221;. I immediately get that message pushed to my phone and can then open <a href="http://overcommittedapps.com/ember/">Ember</a> on my iPhone to immediately drop into the campfire and find out what&#8217;s going on. That means at the airport, in bed, or at a bar. It&#8217;s a really amazing flow.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://prowl.weks.net/">Prowl</a> you can get all your growl notifications pushed to your iPhone. It&#8217;s a simple plug-in that pushes every growl message you get, to your phone. But we don&#8217;t want every message sent to our phone. So here&#8217;s the quick lesson on my awesome strategy for keeping the noise down while getting the important things.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You need to purchase Prowl from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320876271">app store</a></li>
	<li>You need sign up with the prowl service. Register <a href="https://prowl.weks.net/register.php">here</a></li>
	<li>Read installation <a href="http://prowl.weks.net/installation.php">instructions</a> or just skip ahead</li>
	<li>Download the <a href="http://prowl.weks.net/static/Prowl_1.0.4_growlView.zip">plug-in</a></li>
	<li>Install it</li>
	<li>Now you have to set it up which is the <span class="caps">TRICKY</span> part</li>
	<li>Go to the app that you want to Prowl, because you don&#8217;t want <span class="caps">EVERY</span> growl notification going to your phone. Just the apps that you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090812-jwd7jjf4hyx7x3pneibwsc4624.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>Set the display style for the app to &#8220;Prowl&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Butttt the trick is, you dont want it to always use Prowl. That would be annoying. You want the app to use Growl while you&#8217;re using your computer, but Prowl when you&#8217;re away. So&#8230; you trick it out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Go to the display options tab and configure Prowl</li>
	<li>Add your username and password</li>
	<li>Now, this is the most crucial step:</li>
	<li>Set Prowl up to only work if your computer has been idle for a set amount of time</li>
	<li>And tell it what growl style to use when you haven&#8217;t been idle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090812-jrcggnuuyjdqsswf29xuj2rdpr.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And you&#8217;re all set up. So all day long as I work, Campfire (via the awesome <a href="http://propaneapp.com">Propane.app</a>) will growl to my screen. But, the second I&#8217;m away from my computer for longer than 5 minutes, all the growl notifications from Campfire will be sent via push notification to my iPhone.</p>
<p>This is an amazing flow, especially when you know everyone is using it. It means you can page them remotely anytime you really really need them. It&#8217;s the future.</p>
